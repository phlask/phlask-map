        The project was conceived as a Social Practice art project to use
        technology as an artistic medium to build social cohesion for solving
        collective sustainability issues.

        Recognizing that the public plumbing infrastructure can much more
        efficiently distribute water than more energy-intensive, wasteful
        distribution of single-use plastic bottles, we determined that
        encouraging users to obtain water from the public water system instead
        of single-use plastic bottles would have net-positive impacts of
        reducing waste and reducing energy consumption.

        While the Philadelphia Water Department maintains many public drinking
        fountains throughout the city, they are scarce when compared to the
        ubiquity of private taps at restaurants, shops, cafes, businesses and
        even people&apos;s homes. While every citizen already has the right to
        ask the proprietor to share water from their tap, this isn&apos;t a
        culturally normalized behavior. Unspoken norms of patronage and
        privacy, coupled with policies like &ldquo;restroom is for customers
        only,&rdquo; give the impression that private businesses may not be
        willing to share water, which would discourage even asking in the
        first place.
      </p>

        We hope that the PHLASK project will help identify businesses that
        reject such boundaries and would like to normalize water sharing. This
        project is a conscious effort to create and normalize, what we believe
        is, a more environmentally sustainable behavior.
