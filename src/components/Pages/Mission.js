        PHLASK: a pun on the word ‘flask’ to also symbolize Philadelphia (PHL)
        + Ask; to ‘phlask’ for water
      </p>
      <p>
        The PHLASK mission is simple: expand accessibility to water and reduce
        waste associated with distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        Water should remain abundant, clean and accessible to everyone.
        PHLASK&apos;s mission is to help people find publicly available
        sources of water, and to encourage private enterprises to provide
        public access to their water infrastructure - simply by PHLasking.
        Single-use water bottles are costly and wasteful. The PHLASK Ecosystem
        is a simple, cost-effective way to reduce our dependence on single-use
        water bottles, and an efficient solution to mitigating many of the
        negative externalities of consuming single-use plastic water bottles.
        We hope to normalize water-sharing and challenge the ethics of
        enterprises who exploit public water sources and environmental
        sovereignty for profiteering.
      </p>
      <h3>How to PHLASK</h3>
      <p>
        PHLASKing is simple. Look on the PHLASK Map for the nearest accessible
        tap and go fill up your vessel.
      </p>
      <h4>Public tap</h4>
      <p>
        Fill up and enjoy the benefits of our taxes serving our basic human
        needs!
      </p>
      <h4>Private tap</h4>
      <p>
        Follow the instructions on the PHLASK MAP given by the proprietor for
        how they’ve accommodated sharing water.
      </p>
      <h4>Sharing water</h4>
      <p>
        Let us know you’d like to share access to your water tap! Just fill
        out the form and provide some simple instructions for PHLASKers to
        know how they can politely and unobtrusively access your tap.
      </p>

      <h3>Is it too much to PHLASK for?</h3>
      <p>
        Private taps are affixed in a variety of locations, and can incur
        varying degrees of intrusion upon the proprietor to share. While
        respecting the relative inconvenience of providing access, we have
        faith that proprietors who ideologically agree with the mission would
        be willing to sustain the minor inconvenience for the greater good of
        sharing water and reducing waste. The Philadelphia Water Department
        charges half a cent per gallon; the cost of filling up a typical 16 fl
        oz. water bottle, or PHLASK Bottle, is only 1/14 of a cent.
