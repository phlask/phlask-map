- Code coverage
- Enable more deterministic testing
    - Force map location (this is kind of addressed via our default location mechanism)
    - Force loading of test data
        - this needs to be done, testing with live data is going to be a pain since changing map location is unintuitive
        - this is currently done by overriding the DB URL with an environment variable at build time
        - this should be done by using an environment variable to reference a local dynamically-generated DB at build time (this dynamic generation would also need to be configured as input to the test)
    - Enable local upload of files instead of using firebase
- Use baseURL to enable local vs targetted testing
- Set up Junit test report handling
