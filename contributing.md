## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to PHLASK? It always best to attend to for Philly Hack Nights to general understanding of what's needed. Most issues are created and assigned at Hack Nights. If you need more help on how to contribute to open source. You can learn how from this free series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

1. Create your own fork of the code: <https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo>
2. Develop your changes in your fork (See the [README](README.md) to view how you can test your changes locally)
   - If you are new to Git & GitHub, we would recommend Sections 1.5, 1.6, and Chapter 2 of the online [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
   - If you have any questions about the development workflow, feel free to ask us for help via the Code For Philly Slack #phlask channel (Keeping the [Code of Conduct](https://codeforphilly.org/pages/code_of_conduct/) in mind)
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it, open a Pull Request: <https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork>

## How to report a bug

If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Message Billy, Taylor, Khalil, Gabriel on the Code For Philly Slack #phlask Channel (or directly) instead.

For non-security bug reports, [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/phlask/phlask-map/issues) and choose the Bug Report template. Follow the template, where possible, to provide the necessary information to address the bug.

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

Have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement to existing functionality? [Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/phlask/phlask-map/issues) and select the Feature Request template. We use GH issues to plan for things to work on as well as track ongoing work on our [project board](https://github.com/phlask/phlask-map/projects/1).
