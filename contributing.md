If you need more help on how to contribute to open source. You can learn how from this free series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github)

1. Create your own fork of the code: https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo
2. Develop your changes in your fork (See the [README](README.md) to view how you can test your changes locally)
    * If you are new to Git & GitHub, we would recommend Sections 1.5, 1.6, and Chapter 2 of the online [Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)
    * If you have any questions about the development workflow, feel free to ask us for help via the Code For Philly Slack #phlask channel (Keeping the [Code of Conduct](https://codeforphilly.org/pages/code_of_conduct/) in mind)

# How to report a bug
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Message Billy, Taylor, Khalil, Gabriel on the Code For Philly Slack #phlask Channel (or directly) instead.

For non-security bug reports, [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/phlask/phlask-map/issues) and choose the Bug Report template. Follow the template, where possible, to provide the necessary information to address the bug.

# How to suggest a feature or enhancement
Have an idea for a new feature or an enhancement to existing functionality? [Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/phlask/phlask-map/issues) and select the Feature Request template. We use GH issues to plan for things to work on as well as track ongoing work on our [project board](https://github.com/phlask/phlask-map/projects/1).
